# virtex-ng

This is the source code of Virtex-NG, an old ISP management system developed by me arround 2006 to 2014.

It was targeted to Brazilian market and used on a few ISPs.

I found it on an old hard drive and I don't know if it was one of the latest versions. I upload here due to portifolio purposes only.

I use to run this software on top of FreeBSD.

At that time I decided to write every function in brazilian portuguese, so the code was more readable and understandable by every member of our team.
